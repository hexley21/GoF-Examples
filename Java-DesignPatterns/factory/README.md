# Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. In other words, it provides an abstract factory for creating objects, where the concrete classes that implement the factory method can determine which type of object to create.

The Factory Method pattern is useful in situations where a class cannot anticipate the type of objects it must create. By allowing subclasses to decide which type of object to create, the Factory Method pattern promotes loose coupling, since the client code only interacts with the factory interface, and does not need to know anything about the concrete classes that are being instantiated.

## Benefits of the Factory Method Pattern

- Provides a way to create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client code
- Promotes loose coupling by allowing the client code to interact with the factory interface, rather than the concrete classes
- Allows for easy extensibility by allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created
- Simplifies the code by moving the object creation code to a separate class

## Example Usage

Suppose you have an application that needs to create different types of objects depending on the input provided by the user. One way to achieve this would be to use a switch statement in your code to determine which object to create. However, this approach becomes unwieldy and hard to maintain as the number of objects and their types increase.

Instead, you could use the Factory Method pattern to create objects. You would define an interface for creating objects, and each concrete class that implements this interface would be responsible for creating a specific type of object. This way, the client code only needs to interact with the factory interface, and does not need to know anything about the concrete classes that are being instantiated.

For example, in our code, we defined a `DeveloperFactoryInterface` interface that has a `createDeveloper()` method. Each concrete class that implements this interface can determine which type of `Developer` object to create. This way, we can easily add new types of `Developer` objects by simply creating a new concrete factory class that implements the `DeveloperFactoryInterface`.

In summary, the Factory Method pattern provides a way to create objects in a flexible and extensible manner, while promoting loose coupling between classes. It's a powerful tool for creating complex systems, and should be used whenever you need to create objects in a way that is both flexible and easy to maintain.
