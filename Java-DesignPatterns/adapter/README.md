# Adapter Pattern

The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, converting the interface of one class into another interface that clients expect.

## General Idea
The Adapter pattern is useful when you have existing code or classes that you want to reuse, but their interfaces don't match the requirements of your current system. By creating an adapter, you can make these incompatible classes work seamlessly together.

## Advantages of using Adapter Pattern
- Reusability: The Adapter pattern allows you to reuse existing classes or components that may have useful functionality but don't match the required interface.
- Flexibility: It provides flexibility by allowing classes to work together that wouldn't otherwise be compatible due to different interfaces.
- Modularity: The pattern promotes modularity by separating the adaptation logic from the core logic of the classes involved.

## Use Cases
- Legacy code integration: When you need to integrate legacy code or third-party libraries into your system that have incompatible interfaces, the Adapter pattern can bridge the gap.
- Interface conversion: When you have multiple interfaces serving similar purposes, the Adapter pattern can be used to convert one interface to another, enabling interoperability.
- System extensibility: The Adapter pattern allows you to extend the functionality of existing classes without modifying their source code.

## Example Usage

Suppose we have two interfaces, `AnalogSignal` and `DigitSignal`, representing analog and digit signals respectively. We want to convert an analog signal to a digit signal using the Adapter pattern.

We have implemented the following classes:

- `AnalogSignal` interface and `FloatAnalogSignal` class that represents an analog signal using float data.
- `DigitSignal` interface and `BinaryDigitSignal` class that represents a digit signal using binary data.
- `AnalogToDigitAdapter` class that acts as an adapter, converting an `AnalogSignal` to a `DigitSignal`.

In the provided code example, we demonstrate the usage of the Adapter pattern:

1. We create an instance of `FloatAnalogSignal` and print the analog signal.
2. We create an instance of `BinaryDigitSignal` and print the digit signal.
3. We create an instance of `AnalogToDigitAdapter` and print the adapted digit signal.

By using the Adapter pattern, we can seamlessly convert and work with different types of signals, even though they have different interfaces.
