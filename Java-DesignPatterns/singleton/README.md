# Singleton Design Pattern

The Singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures that only one instance of a class is created throughout the application and provides a global point of access to that instance.

## When to use the Singleton pattern?

Use the Singleton pattern when:

- You need to restrict the instantiation of a class to a single object.
- You want to provide a global access point to that object.
- You want to control the access to shared resources or configurations.

## Example

Let's consider an example where we have a `JavaDeveloperFactory` class, and we want to ensure that only one instance of this factory is created.

```java
public class JavaDeveloperFactory {
    private static JavaDeveloperFactory instance;

    // Private constructor to prevent direct instantiation
    private JavaDeveloperFactory() {
        // Initialization code here
    }

    public static synchronized JavaDeveloperFactory getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new JavaDeveloperFactory();
        }

        return instance;
    }

    // Other methods and functionalities
}
```

In the above code example, the `JavaDeveloperFactory` class is implemented as a Singleton. It ensures that only one instance of `JavaDeveloperFactory` is created by making the constructor private and providing a static `getInstance()` method to access the single instance.

By using the Singleton pattern, we can ensure that multiple instances of the `JavaDeveloperFactory` class are not created, and we can globally access the single instance throughout the application.

Note: It's important to make the implementation thread-safe, as shown in the example, if the Singleton instance needs to be accessed by multiple threads concurrently.

## Conclusion

The Singleton pattern provides a way to ensure that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global access point to that instance. It is useful in scenarios where a single instance needs to be shared across multiple parts of the application.

In our code example, we used the Singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of `JavaDeveloperFactory` is created, allowing consistent creation of `JavaDeveloper` objects throughout the application.
